The **Proxmox Backup Client Manager** (PBCM) is a centralized management system for controlling multiple `proxmox-backup-client` instances across your infrastructure. It consists of a lightweight Node.js agent running on your clients and a central Fastify/React-based server providing a dashboard and API.

## 🚀 Features

- **Centralized Management:** View and manage all your backup clients from a single web dashboard.
- **Job Scheduling & Execution:** Configure remote backup jobs, define schedules (cron-like), and trigger immediate backups or restores.
- **Global History & Sync:** Centralized job execution history synchronized from all clients for a unified overview.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** View live log streams and status updates of ongoing backup and restore runs via WebSockets.
- **File Browser:** Browse the remote file system of your clients directly from the web interface for selective backups or restores.
- **Secure Communication:** Use secure WebSocket connections between clients and the server, authenticated via short-lived registration tokens.
- **Daily Maintenance:** Automated cleanup of old job histories and schedule states to keep the local database lean.
- **Authentication:** Supports local admin authentication and OIDC (OpenID Connect) for Single Sign-On.

## 🏗 Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo containing four main components:

1.  **Server Backend (`server/backend`):** A Fastify API server acting as the control plane. It holds the SQLite database for configurations and job histories.
2.  **Server Frontend (`server/frontend`):** A modern React SPA (Single Page Application) built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
3.  **Client Agent (`client`):** A lightweight Node.js daemon that wraps the `proxmox-backup-client` CLI, listens for commands, executes scheduled jobs, and reports back via WebSockets.
4.  **Shared Library (`shared`):** Single source of truth for TypeScript types, Zod validation schemas, and constants used by all components.

## 🐳 Quick Start (Docker Compose)

### Server

The easiest way to get the server running is using Docker Compose. A production-ready example `compose.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml
services:
    pbcm-server:
        container_name: pbcm-server
        # The image is multi-platform and supports both x86_64 and ARM64
        image: ghcr.io/stefgo/pbcm-server:latest
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        volumes:
            - ./server-data:/app/server/backend/data
            - ./server-config.yaml:/app/server/config.yaml
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            - NODE_ENV=production
```

1. Copy `server/config.example.yaml` to `server-config.yaml` and configure your settings (like OIDC).
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` (Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`).

### Client

For the client agent, you also need to pass the host's files that you wish to backup, as well as the configuration.

```yaml
services:
    pbcm-client:
        container_name: pbcm-client
        # Use pbcm-client:latest for x86_64 or pbcm-client-arm64:latest for ARM64 (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
        image: ghcr.io/stefgo/pbcm-client:latest
        volumes:
            - ./client-config.yaml:/app/client/config.yaml
            - ./client-data:/app/client/data
            # Mount the host root to allow backing up host files
            - /:/mnt/host:ro
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            - NODE_ENV=production
```

1. Copy `client/config example.yaml` to `client-config.yaml`.
2. Provide the Server URL and a newly generated registration token (obtained from the web dashboard).
3. Run `docker compose up -d`.

## 🔧 Development

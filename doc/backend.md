# ⚙️ Backend Architecture

This documentation details the architecture of the server backend (`server/backend`), which serves as the control plane for the Proxmox Backup Client Manager.

## 📂 Project Structure

The backend is built using **Fastify** as the core framework, written in **TypeScript**. It follows a standard **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**-like architecture combined with centralized services for external integrations.

```

```

## 🏗 Core Components

### 1. Controllers (`src/controllers/`)

Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. They enforce input parsing, delegate business logic to `services`, and format Fastify replies.

- **Example**: `ClientController.ts` handles REST operations like fetching, deleting clients, or triggering backups.

### 2. Services (`src/services/`)

Services contain the heavy business logic of the application. They are designed as singletons or static classes that multiple controllers can rely on.

- **`ProxyService.ts`**: The central communication hub. It manages active agent and dashboard connections, handles request/response correlation for agent commands, and maintains an in-memory job configuration cache.
- **`AuthService.ts`**: Handles user authentication, OIDC flows, and JWT generation.
- **`SettingsService.ts`**: Manages global application settings and persistence.
- **`CleanupService.ts`**: Periodic tasks to prune old history logs or inactive tokens.

### 3. Routes (`src/routes/`)

Routes are Fastify plugins. They map HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific methods in the Controllers and handle generic middleware (e.g., verifying JWT tokens).

### 4. WebSocket Controller & ProxyService

Real-time communication is handled via WebSockets (using `@fastify/websocket`).
The `WebSocketController` acts as the entry point, while `ProxyService` manages the lifecycle of these connections.

- **Authentication**: Incoming agent connections are validated against tokens and IP restrictions.
- **Connection Management**: `ProxyService` tracks online agents and active dashboard sessions.
- **Job Caching**: When an agent connects, `ProxyService` automatically refreshes its local job cache to ensure high-speed retrieval of job configurations.
- **Broadcasting**: `ProxyService` multicasts events (like job progress or log updates) from agents to all connected dashboards.

## 🗄 Database Management

The backend relies on **SQLite3** wrapped with `better-sqlite3` for fast, synchronous database operations.

- The `core/` directory handles initializing the DB file location and running schemas.
- It stores: User credentials, Client tokens, Registered Clients, PBS Configurations, and complete Job Histories.

_(Note: Database migrations using `umzug` are planned/implemented to handle schema updates.)_

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- **Local Login**: Standard username/password validation against bcrypt-hashed passwords in SQLite.
- **OIDC Login**: OpenID Connect flow supported out of the box. Redirects to Provider and exchanges the callback code for a local JWT session.
- **Agent Auth**: Agents authenticate via WebSockets using tokens generated on the dashboard.

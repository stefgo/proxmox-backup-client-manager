 * render, where no hook can hand it over.
 *
 * - No refetch on window focus or on the browser's `online` event: the dashboard socket
 *   keeps the cache current, and its reconnect -- not the browser's idea of being online
 *   -- is what invalidates everything (see `WebSocketProvider`).
 * - No retry: an offline client answers its jobs and its file system with a refusal that
 *   the page has to show at once, and an expired session must never be asked again.

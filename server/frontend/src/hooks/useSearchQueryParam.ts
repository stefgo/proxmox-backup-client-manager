/**
 * A single query parameter as state, kept in the URL so it survives a reload and travels
 * with a shared link.
 *
 * It merges rather than replaces. `setSearchParams({ x })` -- the shape this started out as
 * -- drops every other parameter, which is invisible while a page has only one, and turns
 * into two features deleting each other the moment it has two: a list's `search` and the
 * tab it sits behind were exactly that pair.
 *
 * Writes `replace` the history entry. Typing into a search field is not a destination, and
 * a character-by-character history would make the back button spell the query backwards.
 *
 * An empty value removes the parameter instead of writing `?search=`, so a cleared field
 * leaves the URL as clean as it found it.

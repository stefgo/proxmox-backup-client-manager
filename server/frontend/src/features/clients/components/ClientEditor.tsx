 * Edits what a client *is*: its name and, for an outbound client, where the server dials it.
 * A page of its own, at `/client/:clientId/edit`.
 *
 * The SSH tunnel is deliberately not here. It lives behind its own action in the client
 * list ({@link ClientTunnelEditor}) because it is a different resource with its own
 * endpoints and its own failure modes — and because it is not part of what a client is,
 * but of how a PBS is reached from it. Keeping the two apart also keeps this editor's save
 * button honest: it submits the one form it sits under and nothing else.
 *
 * Leaving is a navigation, and the control for it sits in the card's header — the one part
 * of the form that is in reach from every scroll position without a floating bar over the
 * content. Where it goes is the caller's business: the client list and the client detail
 * page both open this editor, and `location.state.from` is how each says where back is.

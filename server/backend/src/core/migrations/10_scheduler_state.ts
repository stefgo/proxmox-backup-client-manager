/**
 * One row per scheduler: the run in progress, the last run it finished, and what it has to
 * remember from one run to the next. Written over on every run -- there is no history; a
 * run that failed or was cut short shows on the settings page and in the log.
 *
 * `running_*` is set while a run is in progress and cleared when it ends, so `last_*` always
 * describes a finished run and the page keeps showing it during a long sweep. A row still
 * carrying `running_since` at startup belongs to a run the server did not live to finish.

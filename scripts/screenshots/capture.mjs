 *
 * No backend, no database and no agent are involved. The dashboard's data comes from
 * Playwright's request interception (see fixtures.mjs) and the built bundle is served by
 * the small static server next door, so a run is reproducible on any checkout and in CI.
 *
 * Three things keep the output stable between runs, which is what stops this from
 * producing a fresh diff for all fourteen files every time it is invoked:
 *
 *   - the clock is frozen to fixtures.FIXED_NOW, so "2 hours ago" stays two hours ago,
 *   - the timezone is pinned to UTC, so the same run does not render differently on a
 *     laptop in Berlin and a runner in London,
 *   - the version in the header is pinned to the root package.json (see PINNED_VERSION),
 *     which otherwise carries the commit hash and a `-dirty` marker from git.
